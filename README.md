# Addictive-Solitaire
Addictive Solitaire Game. In progress

Hello everyone! Welcome to my Addictive Solitaire game written in JavaFX!

I will add the rules when I am closer to a true working beta and add pictures as well.

Things need to complete.
  1. Add the GNU GPL License to this project.
  2. Change the card images to something more easily readable when scanned. i.e. <u>|5â™¥ |</u>
  3. Apply CSS Styling.
  4. Background is now the card images scrolling. Change the implementation to allow for resizing of the main menu screen.
