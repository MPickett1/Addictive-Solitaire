Addictive Solitaire Game. In progress

Hello everyone! Welcome to my Addictive Solitaire game written in JavaFX!

I will add the rules when I am closer to a true working beta and add pictures as well.

Things need to complete.
  1. Add the GNU GPL License to this project.
  2. Set up some form of local DB that stores scores, times, and entered name.    ___
  3. Change the card images to something more easily readable when scanned. i.e. |5â™¥ |
  4. Apply CSS Styling.                                                          |___|
  5. Change background picture of main menu to something that doesn't hurt your eyes.
